# password-generator

## Description
The purpose of this assignment was to generate a random password generator using letters, numbers,and/or special characters. In my password generator, a prompt was provided asking how long the user wants the password. Three prompts asking how if they wanted uppercase, lowercase, and numbers in their password. Lastly, the randomized password would appear in the text box below.
